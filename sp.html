  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Umap plot of Shakespeare text</p>
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text was gathered from kaggle dataset <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays'>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays</a></li>
      <li>Spacy en_core_web_lg model was used for tokenization and embeddings</li>
      <li>Text was tokenized and cleaned for stopwords and symbols in the text</li>
      <li>Embeddings were generated and plotted with <a href='https://spacy.io/universe/project/whatlies/'>whatlies</a> library</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    Two main correlations are found, separating modern words from more antiquated words. 
    <br>
    Modern examples: languish, dower, leper, etc.
    <br>
    Antiquated examples: inheritrix, sleepest, shoon, thisn, etc.
    <br>
    The selected model could be used to target words that need more explanation for modern readers and performers.
    <br><br>
    One major outlier group was found, which seems to be composed of words ending in an apostrophe. 
    e.g. howso', whene', howsome', howe', etc.
    <br>This seems to be a result of an issue during stemming or tokenization, as it seems these should be contractions of [word] and 'ever.'
    <br>Regardless, that these are outliers from other contractions is notable.
    <br><br>
    Other notable groupings:
    <ul>
      <li>ordinal numbers</li>
      <li>French words</li>
      <li>animals</li>
      <li>familial words (mother,father, etc.)</li>
      <li>ordinal directions</li>
      <li>-ion and -ment suffix words</li>
    </ul>
